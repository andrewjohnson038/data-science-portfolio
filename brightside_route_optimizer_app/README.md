# Brightside Route Optimizer

A Streamlit application that optimizes delivery routes for Brightside's Fresh Produce PWYC (Pay What You Can) service in the Minnesota metro area, using a combination of machine learning clustering and real-time traffic data to create balanced, efficient routes based on number of team members volunterring to drive delivery routes that day.

## Overview

The Brightside Route Optimizer is designed to efficiently distribute delivery addresses among team members while considering:
- Geographic proximity
- Real-time traffic conditions
- Special delivery requirements
- Route balancing
- Time of day

## How It Works

### Two-Phase Optimization Approach

The application uses a two-phase approach to optimize routes:

1. **Phase 1: Geographic Clustering (K-means)**
   - Uses latitude/longitude coordinates to create initial groups
   - Groups addresses that are geographically close to each other
   - Provides a quick first pass to get reasonable starting groups
   - Special case handling for specific addresses (e.g., '1920 4th Ave S')

2. **Phase 2: Drive-Time Optimization (Google Maps API)**
   - Takes the groups from Phase 1
   - Uses Google Directions API to find optimal driving order
   - Calculates actual drive times between addresses
   - Optimizes routes to minimize total drive time
   - Incorporates real-time traffic data

### Machine Learning Components

#### K-means Clustering
- **Purpose**: Initial geographic grouping of addresses
- **Parameters**:
  - `n_clusters`: Number of route groups (one per driver)
  - `random_state`: Fixed for reproducibility
  - `n_init`: 5 (reduced from 10 for speed)
  - `max_iter`: 100 (limited for performance)
  - `algorithm`: 'elkan' (faster for dense data)

#### Route Balancing
- **Purpose**: Ensure fair distribution of work
- **Process**:
  1. Calculate average drive time across all routes
  2. Identify routes >30% longer than average
  3. Move addresses from long routes to shorter ones
  4. Re-optimize affected routes
  5. Repeat up to 3 times if needed

### Special Cases and Constraints

1. **1920 4th Ave S Rule**
   - Routes containing this address are limited to 3 addresses
   - Extra addresses are redistributed to nearest other group
   - Ensures manageable workload for bag distribution

2. **Size Protection**
   - Minimum route size: 3 addresses
   - Maximum addresses moved per attempt: min(route_size - 3, route_size // 4)
   - Prevents routes from becoming too small or too large

3. **Traffic-Aware Routing**
   - Uses real-time traffic data from Google Maps API
   - Considers current traffic conditions and time of day
   - Provides both base duration and traffic-affected duration

## Implementation Details

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Parallel Processing**
   - Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel geocoding
   - Processes multiple addresses simultaneously
   - 5 worker threads for geocoding
   - 3 worker threads for route optimization

2. **Caching**
   - LRU cache for geocoding results
   - Prevents repeated API calls for same address
   - Cache size: 1000 addresses

3. **API Optimization**
   - Retry logic for API calls (3 attempts)
   - 10-second timeout
   - Traffic-aware routing parameters
   - Batch processing where possible

### Known Limitations and Trade-offs

1. **Geocoding Accuracy**
   - Relies on Nominatim geocoding service
   - May have occasional timeouts or inaccuracies
   - Added "Minnesota, USA" to addresses for better accuracy
   - 1.5-second delay between requests to respect rate limits

2. **Route Balancing**
   - 30% threshold for route balancing
   - May not achieve perfect balance due to:
     - Geographic constraints
     - Special case rules
     - Traffic variations
   - Limited to 3 balancing attempts to prevent infinite loops

3. **Traffic Data**
   - Traffic data availability depends on:
     - Time of day
     - Location
     - Google Maps API coverage
   - Falls back to base duration if traffic data unavailable

4. **Performance vs. Accuracy**
   - Reduced K-means iterations for speed
   - Limited balancing attempts
   - Trade-off between optimization time and route quality
